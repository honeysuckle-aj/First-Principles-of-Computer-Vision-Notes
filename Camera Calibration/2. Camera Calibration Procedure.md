Now we have a [[1. Linear Camera Model]], which is given by the #projection-matrix .
We are ready to calibrate the camera, which means estimate the projection matrix
# Procedure
1. Capture an image of an object *with known geometry*
	1. we have known everything about this cube in terms of its **dimensions**, **every point on this cube** and **every visual feature in 3D**, etc.
	2. ![[Pasted image 20240810110237.png]]
	3. ![[Pasted image 20240810111226.png]]
2. Identify *correspndences* berween 3D scene points and image points.

3. For each corresponding point i in scene nad image:
	1. using #projection-matrix 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20240810111509.png]]
	3. expanding the matrix as linear equations![[Pasted image 20240810111601.png]]
4. Rearranging the terms:

5. Solve for P

# Solve for P
## Scale of Projection Matrix
Projection matrix acts on homogeneous coordinates
![[Pasted image 20240810111815.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240810111823.png]]
Therefore, #projection-matrix $p$ and $kp$ means the same projection.
*Scaling the projection matrix, implies simultaneously scaling the world and camera, which does not change the image*
We can choose any scale we wish.
## Least Squares Solution for P

### option 2
![[Pasted image 20240810112322.png]]
We want $Ap$ as close to 0 as possible and $||p||^2=1$ :

![[Pasted image 20240810112551.png]]
[[eigenvector]] p with smallest [[eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ of matrix $A^T A$ minimize the loss function $L(p)$

Finally we rearrange the elements of p to get our projection matrix $P$.
