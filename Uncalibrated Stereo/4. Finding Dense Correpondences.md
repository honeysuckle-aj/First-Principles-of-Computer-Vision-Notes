[[4. Simple Stereo]] -> Finding Correspondences
we need to search the corresponding points *along* the #epipolar-line 
![[Pasted image 20240818110736.png]]
Every scene *point* has **two corresponding** epipolar lines, one each on the images.
*Attention*: Every **point** has two epipolar lines

Given a point in one image, the corresponding point in the other image must lie on the epipolar line.
# Finding Epipolar Lines
*Given*: #fundamental-matrix and point on left image $(u_l,v_l)$ (*We have estimated it by manually finding a set of correspdences*)
*Find*: Equation of #epipolar-line in the right image.
We have #epipolar-constraint :

Here $a_l=f_{11}u_l + f_{21}v_l+f_{31}, b=...$
## Example

# Finding Correspondences
Along the #epipolar-line we use small widnows to calculate similarities.
