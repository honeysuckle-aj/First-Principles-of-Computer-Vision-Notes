We are trying to **find $\tilde{\mathrm{x}}_l$ or $\tilde{\mathrm{x}}_r$ using $\tilde{\mathrm{u}}_l,\tilde{\mathrm{u}}_r$.**

Expand this function, we get *4 equations and only 3 unknowns.*
# Least Squares Solution

Then that gives us a complete three dimensional depth map of scene.
So now we know how to go from arbitrary views to depth maps of the scene through this calibration process.

One way to make stereo more robust is to use **active illumination**. Active illumination can make unique texture which helps to locate and find *correspondences*.
