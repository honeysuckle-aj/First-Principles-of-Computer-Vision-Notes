This contraption swiches the light into two eyes(the left eye see the right view and the right eye see the left view)

![[Pasted image 20240817153618.png]]This contraption redirects the light to adjust the distance between two eyes. That has the effect of making the world appear smaller or larger based on how it is redirected(in this picture, the world is viewed smaller).

# Pfister's Hen

Use *prisms* to rotate the animal's field of view by 6, 7, 10 or 15 degrees.
Humans and monkeys can adapt to even inverted views, other animals like hens are not able to do it even after months.

The *left* kitten is able to move or rotate by itself while the right kitten isn't. The chain garuntees the two kittens move the same way and see the same scene(actively or passively)

It demonstrated that kittens *actively* exploring their environment *developed normal visually guided behavior*, while *passively* moved kittens *did not*, despite receiving the same visual stimulation.
